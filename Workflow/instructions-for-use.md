1. To match your project's structure, Remember to replace placeholders such as `/path/to/deployment`, `my_module`, and `my_app`.
2. Adapt the deployment script to match your specific deployment setup.
3. Define the `SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_USERNAME`, and `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets in your GitHub repository settings for the SSH deployment step to run securely.
